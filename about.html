    <h1>About SMCC</h1>
    <p>Saint Michael College of Caraga also referred to by its acronym SMCC is a private, Roman Catholic, basic education and higher education institution run by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Butuan in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte in the Philippines.

    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <p> In 1948, Nasipit was still a part of the parish of Buenavista, whose parish priest was the late Fr. Martin Westeinde, a Dutch MSC. As the town progressed, population also increased and business gained momentum with the start of the logging industry of Nasipit Lumber Company (NALCO). Fr Martin and his co-adjutor Fr. Atanacio de Castro saw the need of putting up a secondary school. Fr. De Castro was placed in charge of the school.

       <br> It started its operation on July 1, 1948, with Rev. Fr. Francisco Van Dyke as the first director. He was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Geraldo Blewanus, Rev. Fr. Enrique Van Ma-anen, Rev. Fr. Venancio Portillo, Rev. Fr. Mateo Van Santvoord, and Rev. Fr. Anthony Krol in that order of succession. Rev. Fr. Krol was the last Dutch priest who served as the school director. <br>
        
       <br> The school site is beside the rectory with an area of 1,630 square metres (17,500 sq ft). Fr. Gerard Cruijen, one of the subsequent directors, converted the nipa- wooden structure into a two-storey building with 16 classrooms.<br>

Suarez, the first layman director/principal of the school. Faro Gatchalian followed until 1985, then Mrs. Necita Lim took the helm of directorship until 1991 while acting also as the principal of St. James High School of Buenavista, an adjacent town of Nasipit.
